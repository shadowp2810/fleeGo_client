## 2rd place, Decarbonising The Cities Hackathon 2022 (Tampere, Finland) <br>
There is a big culture for reuse of items in Nordic countries. <br>
The encouragement to buy used items around the world is lower than it should be, <br>
for items that still have plenty more to give. <br>
Our solution for decarbonizing cities is to encourage people to buy used, <br>
by having registered used stores offer points <br>
that translate to discounts on future purchases. <br>
Stores benefit from increased visitors. <br>
As a team of three, <br>
one worked on the Design of where we want to be at launch, <br>
another on the presentation, <br>
and I made an MVP to present made with React, NodeJs and MongoDB. <br>
